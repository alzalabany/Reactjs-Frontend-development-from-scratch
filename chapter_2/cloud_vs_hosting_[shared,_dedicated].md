## Cloud vs Hosting [shared, dedicated] {#cloud-vs-hosting-shared-dedicated}
If you want to host your application or website, you have two options.
1. Dedicated server.
1. Shared hosting.

Shared hosting is when one server hosts several websites/apps each having it's own domain name. How this is done is beyond our scope. However, it suffices to know the pros and cons of such approach.

Shared hosting offers a cheap solution to hosting, you can simply pay for the consumed resources. Moreover you do not concern yourself with the maintenance of the server whatsoever, while having an in-house server requires you to maintain the server yourself.
That being said, shared hosting is usually not sufficient for Web sites with high traffic.
Having a dedicated server is a good option when the traffic is high and money is not a constraint. You can also rent a dedicated server from a Web hosting service, in which case you also remove the hassle of maintaining the server.
It's also worth mentioning that when the data is sensitive, for example in case of banking or military applications, usually the option opted for is an in-house dedicated server.
